### What is OOPs

- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of "objects"

- which can contain data(in the form of "properites") and code(in the form of "method")

- OOP is a popular programming paradigm because it allows for modular, reusable code that can be easier to read, maintain, and scale

- There are two types of OOP languages:
  - Class-Based languages like Java, C++
  - Prototype-Based languages like JS

### Features of OOPs

- There are features or main pillars of Object-oriented programming language
- This defines how the data and actions associated with the data, are organized using code

**OOPs concepts:**

- Objects
- Classes
- inheritance
- polymorphism
- encapsulation
- abstraction

- In a previous post we discussed Javascript classes, objects and properties

**Inheritance**

- Inheritance is a concept where one class(child class) inherits properties and methods from another class(parent class)
- In Javascript, inheritance is achieved throught the use of the extends keyword

```javascript
//parent class
class Animal {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
  eat() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is eating`);
  }
}
//child class
class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name, age, breed) {
    super(name, age);
    this.bread = bread;
  }
  bark() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is barking`);
  }
}
//useage
const myDog = new Dog("Cooper", 5, "Labrador");
myDog.eat();
myDog.bark();
```

**Polymorphism**

- Polymorphism is the ability of objects to use the same function in diferent forms
- This reduces repetition and makes the code snippet useful in many different cases
- In js, polymorphism is achieved throught method overriding or method overloading
- Method overring is where a subclass provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in the parent class
- Method overloading is where a class has multiple methods with the same name but different parameters

Here's an example of polymorphism in js using method overriding

```javascript
//parent class
class Shape {
  constructor(color) {
    this.color = color;
  }
  draw() {
    console.log("Drawing a shape");
  }
}
//child class
class Circle extends Shape {
  draw() {
    console.log(`Drawing a ${this.color} cirlce`);
  }
}
class Rectangle extends Shape {
  draw() {
    console.log(`Drawing a ${this.color} rectangle`);
  }
}
//useage
const cirlce = new Circle("red");
const retangle = new Circle("blue");
cirlce.draw();
retangle.draw();
```

Here both override the draw() method of the parent class,  
but provide their own implementantion of it

**Encapsulation**

- Encapsulation isthe pratice of hiding the internal details of an object from outside world

```javascript
class Crush {
  #name = ""; //private field

  constructor(initialName) {
    this.#name = initalName;
  }
  getName() {
    return this.#name;
  }
}
const myCrush = new Crush("Ngọc Huyền");
console.log(myCrush.getName()); // Output: Ngọc Huyền
```

- By encapsulating the #name field within the Crush class, we are preventing direct access to the #name field from outside of the class
- This is an example of how encapsulation can help to prevent unwanted modifications in a real-world scenario such as managing a name

**Abstraction**

- Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details while showing only the necessary information to the user

```javascript
class Payment {
  constructor(amount) {
    this.amount = amount;
  }
  pay() {
    throw new Error("pay() method must be implemented");
  }
}
class StripePayment extends Payment {
  constructor(amount, cartNumber) {
    super(amount);
  }
  pay() {
    console.log(`Paying ${this.amount} vim Stripe`);
    //Stripe payment gateway implementation
  }
}
class PaypalPayment extends Payment {
  constructor(amount) {
    super(amount);
  }
  pay() {
    console.log(`Paying ${this.amount} vim Paypal`);
  }
}
const payment1 = new StripePayment(100);
payment1.pay(); // Paying $100  vim Stripe
const payment2 = new PaypalPayment(50);
payment2.pay(); //Paying $50 vim Paypal
```

- In this example, the Payment class is the abstract class that defines the interface for making payments
- It has a pay method that is abstract and must be implemented by its subclasses
- The StripePayment and PaypalPayment classes are concrete classes that implement the pay method for their respective payment gateways
